Three guiding rules / principles for this class are...

1)Tinker 

2)Do not take out or use other electronics

3)Interact and talk with other students if you need help
 
When this is practiced students will encounter a problem and tinker on the computer and not on their phone and if they encounter a problem while doing something they will ask the people around them for help.

The problem solving process is to define the problem, then to generate solution, after that you will decide the course of action. Once you do that you will implement that solution and evaluate the situation.

The motivation for this process is to be able to find your own solution for each problems.

This relates to perkins research by trying to follow what he found out by doing this process.
