Explain this code:
public Animation Playeranime, up, down, left, right, sprite, wait;
    public Player() throws SlickException {
        SpriteSheet runningSS = new SpriteSheet(
                "res/ogrespritesheet.png", 64, 64, 0);
        up = new Animation();
        up.setAutoUpdate(true);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(0, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(1, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(2, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(3, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(4, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(5, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(6, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(7, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(8, 8), 330);

This sets the animations for the player going up

Why would it be unrealistic / unproductive  to memorize Slick syntax - what are the skills we were trying to practice?
It wouldn't be too useful because of autocomplete and because we're probably not going to use it for any other project

What is an array?
An array is a list of data

How do you make an array? Give an example.
the syntax is datatype[], like int[]

What is an ArrayList?
a list of objects

How do you make an arraylist?
public ArrayList<Orb> orblist = new ArrayList();

In Netbeans, make an arraylist. Use autocompletion with the created arraylist (the '.' and pop-up):
What are three useful arraylist methods that you identified?
clone(), remove(), replaceAll()

What is the difference between an array and an arraylist?
arrays store data, arrayLists store objects

How could we make a health counter for an avatar?
have an arraylist of different little chunks of health so when you lsoe health it hould remove from the arraylist and it would look like a sick healthbar
