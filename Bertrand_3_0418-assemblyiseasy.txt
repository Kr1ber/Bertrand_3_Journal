For what computational reason did you type elf64?
elf64 is referring to the 64 bit operation system.

Why did you use ld?
ld is used to compile.

Why did you not have to use chmod to make sample executable?
chmod changes file permissions


global _start
        section .text
_start:
        mov     rax, 1
        mov     rdi, 1
        mov     rsi, message
        mov     rdx, 19
        syscall

        mov     eax, 60
        xor     rdi, rdi
        syscall
message:
        db      "Kristopher Bertrand", 10


What problem did you have to solve to get it to work?

In order to get it to work I changed the mov rdx value to the amount of letters in my name
.
