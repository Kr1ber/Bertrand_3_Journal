Write a Java method to return the cubed value of some number.

public int cube(int x){
	int placeholder = x;
	x = x * placeholder;
	x = x * placeholder;
	return x;
}

Write an Arduino function to return the cubed value of some number.

int cube(int x){
	int y = x;
	int z = y * x;
	int result = z * x;
	return result;
}

Create the class, an object, and class constructor for class student

class Student{
	String name;
	int grade;
	boolean passing;
	boolean work;
	Student(int x, int y, String name){
		if(this.work){
			this.grade++;
		}
		if(this.grade >= 70){
			this.passing = true;
		}
		
	}
}

public Student student1;

student1 = new Student(100, 100, "Rhys");

Describe-if we were to continue with Arduino-what would you create?

If we were to continue with the Arduino what I would do is I would continue the project I originally had planned but I would do more advanced sogs now that I know more about it, and since I did not get very far it would be as if it is still a new project.
