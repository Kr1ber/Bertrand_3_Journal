What I have done so fat is I have made the arduino play a song when you run it.

What I need to do is to make two more songs and add buttons and lights in order to play each of them at the press of a button and know which one is playing with the light.

No I will not be able to turn it in on Friday

Right now I have not made any significant code changes or anything I would count as code changes.

I have not created any functions.
