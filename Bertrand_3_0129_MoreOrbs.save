A class constructor is used to create a new class with variables that you set
before you call or instantiate an instance of that class.

For orbs, we should include a height, width, and if it does damage, the 
damage variable. And an image for the object.

The orbs should have methods that do damage to the player when they interact
with him/her. Also have methods that make them dissapear when you collide
with them, and possibly methods that change the power of them
