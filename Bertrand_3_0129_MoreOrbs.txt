A class constructor is used to create a new class with variables that you set
before you call or instantiate an instance of the class.

For orbs, we should include a height, width, and assuming that it does damage, a 
damage variable. And an image for the object.

The orbs should have methods that do damage to the enemy when they interact
with him/her. Also have methods that make them dissapear when they collide
with the enemy.
