Define a class Rat
Rat(int a, int b) {
        this.x = a;
        this.y = b;
}

Provide the code to declare and instatiate Rats
Rat rat1 = new Rat(200,300);
Rat rat2 = new Rat(400,300);
Rat rat3 = new Rat(300,500);

Explain where the decaration and initialization are placed
In my game, they are declared at the start of the program in the main class, and initialized in the init method, or when and where
we need them.

Provode a two-dimensional array that specifies coordinates for five rats
int[][] ratsLocation = new int[3][2];
ratsLocation[0][0] = 200;
ratsLocation[0][1] = 300;

ratsLocation[1][0] = 400;
ratsLocation[1][1] = 300;

ratsLocation[2][0] = 300;
ratsLocation[2][1] = 500;
