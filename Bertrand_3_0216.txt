How was an array used in your Slick game?

blocked was some sort of array that stored coordinates for tiles that were blocked
An array stores a bunch of some data type, so blocked just used an array of booleans that said 'this tile is blocked' or
'this tile is not blocked'

What might be another use for an array in a different program?

You could store the player's stats like strength, intellegence, etc. in an array of ints and just refer to each of them as
some part of the array, or something like blocked but for something else like the location of secret switches.
