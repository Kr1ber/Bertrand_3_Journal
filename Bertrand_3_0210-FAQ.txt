Make a list of ten problems (e.g., FAQS) you have faced when adding orbs to your game.

1. Where could I get started on my own when I wanted to make the orb instead of relying on another source

2. Why does the orb at first move with the player before you fix it to not do that

3. How do I know what to type after looking at the errors

4. Why does this do what it does

5. I dont know what any of this means
